You are my fire. The one desire. Believe, when I say. I want it that way.

And we are two worlds apart. Can't reach to your heart, when you say, I want it that way.

Tell me why? Ain't nothing but a heartache.
Tell me why? Ain't nothing but a mistake.
Tell me why? I never wanna hear you say, I want it that way.

"hello"
